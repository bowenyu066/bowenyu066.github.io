## Work experience

* **Spring 2025**: Research Assistant
  * [Quantum Measurement Group](https://qm.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  * Extensively apply various machine learning force field (MLFF) models, especially MACE, to predict relevant physical properties of materials ( \\(\Gamma\\)-phonon, heat conductivity, etc.) while preserving accuracy
  * Train a foundational model for non-destructive defect identification from vibrational spectra, specifically phonon density-of-states (PDoS)
  * Supervisor: Professor [Mingda Li](https://web.mit.edu/nse/people/faculty/mli.html)
