YOU ARE AT A WRONG PLACE

GET OUT OF HERE

NOW

<br>

Sorry I was being a bit sharp but this fucking page really does not exist ... My sincerest apology if you are clicking this by accident. A simple click of the homepage button on the top left corner will take you back to the homepage. Now do it.

You are still reading, huh? EXIT THIS PAGE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE OR I MAY GET REALLY ANGRY!

If you are still here, I guess you are not going to leave. I am not sure if I should be happy or sad about this. But anyway, since you are still here, I suggest you consider the following question.

Compute the integral below:

$$
\int_{-1}^1 e^x \sin\sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx
$$

Drop a line in the comment section below if you have the answer.
