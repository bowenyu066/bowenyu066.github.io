## About me

Hello there! I am an undergrad student majoring in Physics (Course 8) and Artificial Intelligence (Course 6-4) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Class of 2027. Before coming to MIT, I studied at the Peking University for one year, where I gained a solid foundation in physics.

I have long hoped to explore the mysteries of the universe and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. With the advancement in physics and AI, I am particularly interested in the intersection of both--how to use AI to solve interesting open problems in many-body physics and material science. Currently, I am working as a UROP student in the [MIT Quantum Measurement Group](https://qm.mit.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [Mingda Li](https://web.mit.edu/nse/people/faculty/mli.html). My research focuses on using machine learning to accelerate relevant material property calculations.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I enjoy long-distance running, playing ping-pong, watching movies, and reading classics. I am also a big fan of the [Three-Body Problem Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) by Liu Cixin, which has greatly influenced my understanding of physics and the universe. I am eager to meet like-minded individuals who share my passion for science and technology.

My resume is attached [here](https://bowenyu066.github.io/cv/).
